Hello! This is a page to upload pets available for adoption. There are 3 types of pets, cats dinos and dogs. There is a "submit pet for adoption" modal that if you click on it gives a form to the right with required fields. There is also a delete button on every pet card that can be pressed once one is adopted! the pets are sorted by "all" as well as their pet type in buttons at the top of the screen.
